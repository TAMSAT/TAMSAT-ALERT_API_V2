    "# TAMSAT-ALERT API for soil moisture (Version 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "The TAMSAT-ALERT API is software (Python code) designed to allow users to easily generate tailored agricultural drought information for their crop growing season using TAMSAT soil moisture estimates and forecasts. The API provides both soil moisture conditions from the start of the season up to a current date in the season as well as forecasts out to the end of the season.\n",
    "The software is designed so that users do not need to edit the Python code and only need provide minimal inputs to allow the API to run, namely:\n",
    "* Period of interest\n",
    "* Region of interest\n",
    "* The current date\n",
    "* The climatological period from which soil moisture anomalies are derived\n",
    "* Meteorological tercile forecast weights\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information, the API will download the required data, compute the drought metrics, apply the forecast weightings and output the drought metrics in several formats, depending on the data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to run this Notebook\n",
    "To run this Notebook, users must complete each of the six input arguments below (example options have been provided). Once these arguments have been provided, click on the 'Run' button above. This will execute each cell in the Notebook sequentially. Things to note:\n",
    "* `[ ]` on the left hand side of each cell indicates the cell has not been executed yet.\n",
    "*`[*]` on the left hand side of the cell indicates the process indicated in the cell is being processed. You will not be able to move to the next cell if the current cell is still processing.\n",
    "* When a number appears in `[ ]` (e.g. `[2]`) - this signifies the process for that call has finished. You can then move onto the next cell. The number increases by 1 for each cell executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "If the API completes successfully, outputs will be saved in a folder called `Outputs` in the same directory as the API Python code. Within `Outputs`, a subdirectory will be created for each API run. This subdirectory will be labelled as follows: `<current_date>`_`<date-time>` where:\n",
    "* `current_date` is the date in the season up to which soil moisture estimates are considered and soil moisture forecasts are considered from the day afterwards (see input argument [3] below)\n",
    "* `date-time` is the date and time at which the API was executed. \n",
    "Within this subdirectories, outputs are split between `data` and `images`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting\n",
    "* If you need to stop any process, click on the stop button above (indicated by a black square next to the 'Run' button).\n",
    "* If you need to refresh the Notebook, click on the 'Kernel' button above and select 'Restart & Clear Output' and then click on the red button that appears. This will allow you to begin the Notebook from the start."
